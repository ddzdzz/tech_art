The font Grotesk32x64 was downloaded from [here](http://www.rinkydinkelectronics.com/r_fonts.php). Due to memory limits on the Arduino I modified the file to only a subset of letters and numbers.  
I didn't keep the sound files after the project but they were generic sound effects downloaded from various free sound effect websites.
