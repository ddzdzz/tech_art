        <h1>Final Project</h2>
        <p>
            This project was completely open ended, which made it challenging to come up with a concept. We spent 
            many classes brainstorming themes that would make for cool tech sculptures, or interesting mechanisms 
            that could lend itself to a theme. Finally, we settled on a topic - secrets. Why do people share 
            or keep secrets? How does technology change the way we perceive secrecy?

        <h2>Concept Design</h2>
        <p>
            Our original design was a ballot box that would take in people’s written secrets and eject one, 
            stemming from my and Bennett’s interest in building something with a rotating mechanism. However after 
            consulting our professors, we realized that the form and interaction of our sculpture didn't
            perfectly align with the theme. When picturing the act of sharing a secret, a scene of a person 
            whispering into the ear of another likely comes to mind. Thus we revised our design to a rotating 
            mouth and ear sculpture. 
        </p>
        <p>
            When viewers walk up to our sculpture, they are invited to share a secret with the strange ear. Then 
            the sculpture would rotate to reveal a mouth that recounts a secret shared by a previous viewer. For the 
            design of the mouth and ear soft sculptures, Bonnie drew inspiration from Pop Art. This not only makes 
            the sculpture visually captivating, but modernizes it to suit the theme of exploration of secret sharing 
            in current society.
        </p>

        <h2>Technical Design</h2>
        <p>
            Bennett and I worked closely to integrate the mechanical and electronic components of the sculpture. 
            The main challenge was the rotating sculpture, which needed to spin 180° back and forth. In the default 
            position the rotating component would lay flush with a box that hides the other side of the sculpture, 
            so accuracy was important. We considered a few options for the motor:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Servo motor</li>
            <li>Step motor</li>
            <li>Motor + limit switches</li>
            <li>Motor encoder</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Ultimately we picked the motor and limit switch option which felt the most reliable. The sculpture could 
            be rotated to any angle during building and troubleshooting, so the limit switches ensure that the 
            sculpture can always return to the default position.

        </figure>
        <p>There was also a discussion about how to record people's secrets. If we wanted to be the most unsuspecting,
            we could have the mic record when the volume surpasses a certain threshold while a proximity sensor validates 
            the presence of a person standing in front of the sculpture. But how can we distinguish between a secret and 
            people talking in front of the sculpture? Noise level in the gallery can also fluctuate, so there were too many 
            unknowns overall for this to work well. Instead, we decided to remove all ambiguity by guiding the audience to 
            press a button before whipering into the ear. This doesn't detract from the purpose of the sculpture as the 
            audience still doesn't know what will happen next. Furthermore, it presents a choice between walking 
            away and putting something out there to satisfy their curiosity.
        </p>
        <p>
            With sensors and motors picked out, we planned out the dimensions of the sculpture, the location and size 
            of mounting holes and got to work - Bonnie on the ear/mouth sculpture, Bennett on the mechanical parts and 
            me on electronics. As part of the project deliverable we have put together an "installation manual" 
            detailing the entire build process, which can be found in the 
            <a href="https://github.com/ddzdzz/tech_art/tree/main/Final_projectrepo">repo</a> 
            along with all 3D models and code.

            <br>
            <i>I Eat Babies</i> is a sculptural piece that began as an exploration of human intimacy through communication 
            and storytelling — particularly the sharing of secrets. Through vulnerable exchanges of information, we 
            entrust bits of pieces of ourselves with the world around us. Whether it is to bond or to manipulate, 
            information becomes an intangible tool that humans have come to construct. In modern society, information 
            sharing has never been so accessible. Can we trust technology to keep our secrets? Or are we incentivised 
            to overshare? Thus, <i>I Eat Babies</i> seeks to investigate how each of us interacts with technology and how we 
            react to the information shared with us. 
            <br>
            At first glance, <i>I Eat Babies</i> depicts a rather abstract soft sculpture ear resting on the gallery wall. 
            This personified being presents itself as a trustworthy entity, inviting the audience to whisper into 
            its ear. Unknowingly, an audio recording will be saved. Afterwards, the sculpture turns 180° revealing 
            the backside, featuring a pair of animated red lips with a green tongue. It delivers an automated 
            “Thank You for sharing” message and shares a previous recording of a secret outloud to the viewer — 
            possibly even the viewer’s own secret. The reveal of the mouth challenges the viewer to think about 
            where they place their trust, as things are not always as they seem. Reminiscent of the Pop Art Movement, 
            the colours and material of the soft sculptures play with the idea of modernity, pop culture, and the 
            fabrication of truth and meaning.
