            <h1>Final Project</h1>
            <p>
                This project was completely open ended, which made it challenging to come up with a concept. We spent
                many classes brainstorming themes that would make for cool tech sculptures, or interesting mechanisms
                that could fit into a concept. Finally, we settled on a topic - secrets. Why do people share
                or keep secrets? How does technology change the way we perceive secrecy?
            </p>

            <h2>Concept Design</h2>
            <p>
                Our original design was a ballot box that would take in people’s written secrets and eject one,
                stemming from my and Bennett’s interest in building something with a rotating mechanism. However after
                consulting our professors, we realized that the form and interaction of our sculpture didn't
                perfectly align with the theme. When picturing the act of sharing a secret, a scene of a person
                whispering into the ear of another likely comes to mind. Thus we revised our design to a rotating
                mouth and ear sculpture. They would be mounted to either side of a panel attached to a box to hide
                the other side.
            </p>
            <figure>
                <img src="Assets/fp_concept_sketch.png" class="w-75" alt="drawings of a locked chest and an ear and mouth">
                <figcaption class="fw-light">
                    A rough sketch of the original and revised sculpture designs.
                </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
                When viewers walk up to our sculpture, they are invited to share a secret with the strange ear. Then
                the sculpture would rotate to reveal a mouth that recounts a secret shared by a previous viewer. For the
                design of the mouth and ear soft sculptures, Bonnie drew inspiration from Pop Art. This not only makes
                the sculpture visually captivating, but modernizes it to suit the theme of exploration of secret sharing
                in current society.
            </p>

            <h2>Technical Design</h2>
            <p>
                Bennett and I worked closely to integrate the mechanical and electronic components of the sculpture.
                The main challenge was the rotating panel, which needed to spin 180° back and forth. In the default
                position the rotating component would lay flush with the surface of the outer box,
                so accuracy was important. We considered a few options for the motor:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Servo motor</li>
                <li>Step motor</li>
                <li>Motor + limit switches</li>
                <li>Motor encoder</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Ultimately we picked the motor and limit switch option which felt the most reliable. The sculpture could
                be rotated to any angle during building and troubleshooting, so the limit switches ensure that the
                sculpture can always return to the default position.
            </p>
            <figure>
                <img src="Assets/fp_brainstorm_motor.png" alt="sketch of motor rotating the sculpture">
                <figcaption class="fw-light">Sketch of design. An arm makes contact with the limit switches to stop the
                    rotation.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>There was also a discussion about how to record people's secrets. If we wanted to be the most
                unsuspecting, we could have the mic record when the volume surpasses a certain threshold while
                a proximity sensor validates the presence of a person standing in front of the sculpture. But how can we
                distinguish between a secret and people talking in front of the sculpture? Noise level in the gallery
                can also fluctuate, so there were too many unknowns overall for this to work well. Instead, we decided
                to remove all ambiguity by guiding the audience to press a button before whispering into the ear. This
                doesn't detract from the purpose of the sculpture as the audience still won't know what happens next.
            </p>
            <p>
                As part of project deliverables we have put together an "installation
                manual" detailing the entire build process, which can be found in the
                <a href="https://github.com/ddzdzz/tech_art/tree/main/Final_projectrepo">repo</a>

                <br>
                <i>I Eat Babies</i> is a sculptural piece that began as an exploration of human intimacy through
                communication and storytelling — particularly the sharing of secrets. Through vulnerable exchanges of
                information, we entrust bits of pieces of ourselves with the world around us. Whether it is to bond or
                to manipulate, information becomes an intangible tool that humans have come to construct. In modern
                society, information sharing has never been so accessible. Can we trust technology to keep our secrets?
                Or are we incentivised to overshare?
            </p>
            <p>
                At first glance, <i>I Eat Babies</i> depicts a rather abstract soft sculpture ear resting on the gallery
                wall. This personified being presents itself as a trustworthy entity, inviting the audience to whisper
                into its ear. Unknowingly, an audio recording will be saved. Afterwards, the sculpture turns 180°
                revealing the backside, featuring a pair of animated red lips with a green tongue. It delivers an
                automated “Thank You for sharing” message and shares a previous recording of a secret outloud to the
                viewer — possibly even the viewer’s own secret. The reveal of the mouth challenges the viewer to think
                about where they place their trust, as things are not always as they seem. Reminiscent of the Pop Art
                Movement, the colours and material of the soft sculptures play with the idea of modernity, pop culture,
                and the fabrication of truth and meaning.

            <h2>Improvements</h2>
            <p>
                Notice in the photos and video that the sculpture doesn't sit flush with the box. This is because the
                wires
                coming out the bottom of the rotating panel were getting tangled with the contact arm, preventing it
                from
                hitting the limit switches at the right moment. As an emergency fix I added timers on the rotations. If
                we
                were to do another iteration, we would change the placement of the contact arm to avoid the wires and
                improve cable management. We could also consider changing to a motor with an encoder and use the limit
                switches only as a sanity check.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another lesson learned was that we need properly mount and secure all parts for projects that are open
                to
                the public and frequently interacted with. The button on the sculpture was only secured to the box with
                glue, which is typically adequate for a hobby project, but it was dislodged after only the first day of
                exhibition and we had to go in and fix it.
