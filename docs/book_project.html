            <h1>The Book Project</h1>
            <p>
                For this project we were tasked with creating a sculpture inspired by a book of choice.
                After brainstorming our favourite books, we settled on the play <i>Waiting
                    for Godot</i> by Samuel Beckett. We were intrigued by the premise of two people waiting
                for something that never happens and the imagery of a withered tree anchoring the scene.
            </p>


            <h2>Concept Design</h2>
            <p>
                We chose to explore themes of human existence and absurdism in the book and what better
                way to do that than to put the audience in the shoes of the characters? Thus our design
                came to be - a tree with two chairs underneath. The audience becomes “actors” in the
                scene; the authors of their own play.
            </p>
            <figure>
                <img src="Assets/bp_concept_sketch.jpg" alt="sketch of two chairs under a tree" width="400">
                <figcaption class="fw-light">
                    A rough sketch of the sculpture. Wires will run inside the branches of the tree, which will be
                    constructed using cardboard, followed by a layer of plaster and paint.
                </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
                The sculpture is intended to work as follows: the timer on the sign counts up until two
                people sit down, at which point the text changes to say “Enjoy the show!” If someone gets up too
                soon, they are met with boos to compel them to sit back down and explore the sculpture more. From there
                the visitors are free to do as they please - prompts on the tree leaves offer some ideas.
                When at least one person stands up again, they may be met with a round of applause. We
                originally also planned to light up the tree when the show begins and have them dim as
                leaves are plucked from the tree, but scrapped the idea.
            </p>


            <h2>Technical Design</h2>
            <p>
                Technical requirements for electronics were straight forward:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Electronics must support all desired interactions</li>
                <li>Electronics should be inconspicuous as to not distract from the sculpture itself</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The 3 components I needed to work on were an occupancy sensing mechanism for the chairs, tree lighting,
                and the screen display. An Arduino was the obvious choice for controlling the components.
            </p>
            <p>
                Below are some of my notes on choosing sensors and implementing the interactions.
            </p>
            <div class="scrollable">
                <img src="Assets/bp_brainstorm.png" class="w-100" alt="notes on how to incorporate sensors">
            </div>
            <p>
                In the end the light up leaves were scrapped because we felt it was not central to the
                message of our sculpture to justify the tremendous work needed to implement properly. For
                occupancy sensing on the chairs, I went with force sensing resistors as they were straight
                forward to use - I obtained the long strip ones to span across the seat. After testing out a
                few weights I set a liberal threshold to reasonably distinguish between a person vs. a backpack
                on the chair.

                <br>
                The play Waiting For Godot by Samuel Beckett follows two men who convene under a tree everyday to
                wait for the mysterious Godot to give them a sense of purpose. They pass the time by chatting,
                arguing, and entertaining themselves with absurd antics. Despite this, Godot never arrives and
                they find themselves in a never-ending cycle of waiting.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our sculpture <i>Waiting</i> recreates the setting of the story – a ragged tree and two stools for the
                characters. There is a sign on the tree that counts the time to the next showing of the play,
                waiting for the viewers to complete the scene. By putting the viewers in the same situation as
                the characters in the play, they are faced with the same questions surrounding existence: What
                are we supposed to do? Do we wait for something to happen or leave? The sculpture aims to question
                the agency of the individual in a world of uncertainty, and to challenge the viewer to consider
                their own relationship to time and the meaning they assign to it.

                Our original design with proper chairs, sculpted tree and flashing lights were replaced with
                buckets and paper-mâché. As we worked on the piece, we felt that more organic and abrasive
                materials, form, and texture was more congruent to the nature of human interactions and
                the setting of a stage play. The dangling leaves fluttered in the air conditioned gallery,
                adding another dimension of movement to our sculpture.
            </p>

            <h2>Improvements</h2>
            <p>
                The tree we built was not structurally sound and by the end of the exhibition had toppled over.
                In our original plan the plaster would have reinforced the structure, but when we pivoted to just using
                paper as the bark texture we didn't think about how it would impact the sturdiness of the structure.
                From this experience I learned to always assess downstream impacts after making a design change.
