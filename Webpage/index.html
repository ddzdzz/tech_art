        <h1>Tech Art - Where Engineering Meets Fine Arts</h1>
        <p>
            This was an elective I took that honed my skills of iterative design and 
            interdisciplinary collaboration through the creation of "Tech Art" sculptures. To me a good tech-art 
            piece doesn't mean it's the most technically impressive, rather that the technology feels intuitive to 
            the concept of the piece and deepens the connection to the audience through touch, sound, movement, etc. 
            The following two sculptures were created by a group of 3 students:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Bonnie (Fine Arts)</li>
            <li>Bennett (Mechanical Engineering)</li>
            <li>Diana (Systems Design Engineering)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Click to read more about the design process for each piece! Code and 3D print files can also be found in the repo.</p>
